# Cthulhu Dice
A simple variant of Zombie Dice, a game of risk and chance.

# Rules of Play
Players are people from all walks of life trying desperately to protect themselves against the ancient evil that is awakening.

Players take it in turns to roll dice in the hopes of discovering Elder Signs - protective symbols that can help fight the darkness. But the path is difficult. Minions of Cthulhu are everywhere and the players could easily find themselves snatched from the jaws of salvation by lashing TENTACLES.

On each turn, the player takes H dice (initially 3) from the a cup containing T dice (initially 15). T is made up of Y types of dice (initially 3), namely:
 - Library (Yl) (high chance of success, low chance of failure)
 - Museum (Ym) (equal chance of success and failure)
 - Tomb (Yt) (high chance of failure, low chance of success)

The distribution of Library, Museum and Tomb dice are Tl, Tm and Tt, respectively.

Initially:
 - Tl: 8
 - Tm: 4
 - Tt: 3

All dice have S sides (initially: 6).

Each die has one of three possible outcomes when rolled:
 1. An Elder Sign (Re), a mote of protection against the dark things that lurk. This is what the player wants and counts towards their possible score.
 1. A Clue (Rc). It's not an Elder Sign, but at least it's not a TENTACLE! The player must re-roll this die if they choose to Continue to another round.
 1. TENTACLES (Rt)! Tentacles bad. If they player ever has 3 or more, they score 0 this round.

The player rolls their H dice and acts accordingly:
 - Any Elder Signs they get are added to a pool of Elder Signs (Pe).
 - Any TENTACLES they get are added to a pool of TENTACLES (Pt). If the player ever gets 3 (or more) TENTACLES, they are Downed. They score nothing this round and cannot Continue to another round.

If the player has 2 or fewer TENTACLES, they now have a choice:
 1. Continue to research the ancient power in the hope of uncovering more Elder Signs OR
 1. Retreat to safety with their knowledge of the Elder things and live to fight another day.

If the player chooses to Continue, they must draw a further H-Rc dice from the cup containing the remaining dice (Tr), such that, in a standard game, the player would draw 3 dice if they had just rolled no clues, 2 if they had one clue, 1 if they had two clues and 0 if they had 3 clues. They must then roll these dice and live with the consequences.

If the player chooses to Retreat, their total score is increased by Pe (the number of Elder Signs they have in their pool).

Each time a player chooses to Retreat or is Downed, all dice are returned to the cup and the cup is passed to the next player.

Play continues clockwise until a player manages to gather 13 or more Elder Signs. At which point, the current round continues until each player has taken an equal number of turns. Then, any players with fewer than 13 Elder Signs at this point are devoured. The remaining players get to live on in the knowledge that they are probably next... and the winner is the player with the most Elder Signs.
